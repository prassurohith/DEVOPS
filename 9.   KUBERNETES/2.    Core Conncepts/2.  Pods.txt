2. Pods :
===========

1. What is Pods:
==================
- K8's aim is to deploy our apps in the form of containers on a set of machines that are config as worker nodes in a cluster.
- K8's doesn't deploy containers on workernodes.
- Containers are encapsulated in to a kubernetes object known as "PODS".
- A Pod is a single instance of an app.
- A pod is an smallest object you can create in K8's.
- A Pods usually have one to one relationship b/w containers to scale up create new pods & scaledown to delete existing pods.

2. MultiContainer Pods:
=======================
- A single pod can have multiple containers.
- Helper Container to support main apps processing user data or processing logfile or files etc.
- In above cases you can build multi container in a single pod.
- So when a new app pod created-helper also creates & when it dies the helpers also dies.
- The 2 containers can communicate each other by referring local host = share.

Local N/W + Shared Storage = BussyBox + Sidecar
