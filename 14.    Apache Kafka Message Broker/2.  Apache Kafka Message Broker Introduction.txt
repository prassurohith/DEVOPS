2. Apache Kafka Message Broker :
================================

2.1.  What is Apache-Kafka ?
------------------------------
. Apache Kafka is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system and a robust queue that can handle a high volume of data and enables you to pass 
  messages from one end-point to another. 
. Kafka is suitable for both offline and online message consumption. Kafka messages are persisted on the disk and replicated within the cluster to
  prevent data loss. 
. Kafka is built on top of the ZooKeeper synchronization service. 


2.2. Use Cases:
-----------------
. Kafka can be used in many Use Cases. Some of them are listed below −

Metrics − Kafka is often used for operational monitoring data. 
          This involves aggregating statistics from distributed applications to produce centralized feeds of operational data.

Log Aggregation Solution − Kafka can be used across an organization to collect logs from multiple services and make them available in a 
                           standard format to multiple con-sumers.

Stream Processing − Popular frameworks such as Storm and Spark Streaming read data from a topic, processes it, and write processed data to
                    a new topic where it becomes available for users and applications. Kafka’s strong durability is also very useful in the 
					context of stream processing.
