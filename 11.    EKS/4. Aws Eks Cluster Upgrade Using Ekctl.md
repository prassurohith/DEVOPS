# 4. Aws Eks Cluster Upgrade using Ekctl :

+ An eksctl-managed cluster can be upgraded in 3 easy steps:

1. upgrade control plane version with eksctl upgrade cluster
2. replace each of the nodegroups by creating a new one and deleting the old one
3. update default add-ons (more about this here):
   - kube-proxy
   - aws-node
   - coredns

## Updating control plane version

+ Control plane version upgrades must be done for one minor version at a time.
+ To upgrade control plane to the next available version run:

 '''
   
   eksctl upgrade cluster --name=<clusterName>
 
   '''
   
 + This command will not apply any changes right away, you will need to re-run it with --approve to apply the changes.
 + The target version for the cluster upgrade can be specified both with the CLI flag:
 
   ''' 

       eksctl upgrade cluster --name=<clusterName> --version=1.16
   
   '''
   
+ or with the config file
   
'''
   
   cat cluster1.yaml
   ---
   apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5 
   kind: ClusterConfig

   metadata:
     name: cluster-1
     region: eu-north-1
     version: "1.16"

   eksctl upgrade cluster --config-file cluster1.yaml

'''
