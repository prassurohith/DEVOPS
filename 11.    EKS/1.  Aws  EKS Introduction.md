# 1. Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service:

## 1.1. What is EKS ?

+ Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that you can use to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, 
  operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane or nodes. 
+ Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## 1.2. Why EKS ?

+ Runs and scales the Kubernetes control plane across multiple AWS Availability Zones to ensure high availability.
+ Automatically scales control plane instances based on load, detects and replaces unhealthy control plane instances, 
  and it provides automated version updates and patching for them.
+ Is integrated with many AWS services to provide scalability and security for your applications, 
  including the following capabilities:

1. Amazon ECR for container images
2. Elastic Load Balancing for load distribution
3. IAM for authentication
4. Amazon VPC for isolation

## 1.3. EKS Architecture:

+ Typically, an Amazon EKS cluster consists of two main components, 

### 1. The control plane:

+ In Amazon EKS, the control plane is provided and maintained by AWS in a separate VPC.
+ That run in their own individual virtual private clouds (VPCs). 
+ Eks Control plane nodes componnets like kube-api-server, etcd, kube-controller, core-dns can be automatically install & update.

### 2. The data plane:

+ The nodes that you manage in your VPCs are responsible for running the container images or workloads. 

#### 2.1. Managed node groups:

+ Automates the provisioning and lifecycle management of EC2 Instances.
+ Managed Nodes run EKS Optimized Images.
+ Streamlined way to manage lifecycle of nodes using single AWS/EKS API Calll
  Create,Update,Terminate.
+ Every Node is part of an Auto Scaling Group thats Managed for you by EKS.


### 2.2. Self-managed nodes:

+ User must create Manually EC2 Instances.
+ All Kubernetes Worker Node components like: kubelet, kube-proxy, Docker-Engine, must be installed manually.
+ Updates & Security patches are managed by user manually.
+ Register Node with control Plane.
+ A cluster contains one or more Amazon EC2 nodes that pods are scheduled on. 
+ Amazon EKS nodes run in your AWS account and connect to the control plane of your cluster through the cluster API server endpoint. 

### 2.3. Fargate:

+ Follows a serverless architecture.
+ Fargate will create worker nodes on demand.
+ No Need to provision/maintain EC2 servers.
+ Based on container requirements Fargate will automatically select optimal EC2 Sizing.
+ you only pay for what you use.
