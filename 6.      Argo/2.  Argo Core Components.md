# 2. Argo Core Components:

+ Let's assume you're familiar with core Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Continuous Delivery, and GitOps concepts. 
+ Below are some of the concepts that are specific to Argo CD.

,,,

1.  Application                      :   A group of Kubernetes resources as defined by a manifest. This is a Custom Resource Definition (CRD).
2.  Application source type          :  Which Tool is used to build the application.
3.  Target state                     :   The desired state of an application, as represented by files in a Git repository.
4.  Live state                       :   The live state of that application. What pods etc are deployed.
5.  Sync status                      :   Whether or not the live state matches the target state. Is the deployed application the same as Git says it should be?
6.  Sync                             :   The process of making an application move to its target state. E.g. by applying changes to a Kubernetes cluster.
7.  Sync operation status            :   Whether or not a sync succeeded.
8.  Refresh                          :   Compare the latest code in Git with the live state. Figure out what is different.
9.  Health                           :   The health of the application, is it running correctly? Can it serve requests?
10. Tool                             :   A tool to create manifests from a directory of files. E.g. Kustomize. See Application Source Type.
11. Configuration management         :   tool See Tool.
12. Configuration management plugin  :  A custom tool.
